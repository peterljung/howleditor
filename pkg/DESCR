Howl is a general purpose editor that aims to be both lightweight and fully
customizable. It is built on top of the very fast LuaJIT runtime, uses GTK for
its interface, and can be extended in either Lua or Moonscript.

While Howl uses GTK, its interface is primarily text oriented. Thus, it does not
offer any traditional dialogue boxes, tool bars, or even a menu bar.

Generally speaking, Howl draws a lot of inspiration from Emacs and Vim, and
should feel familiar to anyone who has used any of these editors.

While Howl is all about things being configurable, its policy is to start off
with basic features being enabled rather than disabled where it makes sense.
